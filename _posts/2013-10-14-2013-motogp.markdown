Every year, a few mates and I head down to Phillip Island for the [Australian](http://www.motogp.com.au/){:target="_blank"} round of the [MotoGP](http://www.motogp.com/){:target="_blank"}.

This is a brilliant time of the year for me and something I really look forward to.  Of course, I don't travel anywhere without my camera, so I like to grab a few photo's of the weekend, too.  I'll try to post a few shots from the weekend up here, as I go.

Fingers crossed, it'll be another great year, this year, with lots of thrills, spills and general shenanigans.
