Photography is one of my favourite hobbies. It's always great fun to get out there and find a different shot of something people know well.

It's even more fun going places where we're not supposed to go.

But, sports photography is an entirely different beast.  There are so many "moments", if you blink, you'll miss it.  You need to be ready for anything, all time.  I especially like beach volleyball and the MotoGP.  Because I play beach volleyball, I have a great "feel" for the shot and can get some great shots.  Many of my photo's have been up on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/paulymac/photos_albums){:target="_blank"} for quite some time now.  Feel free to have a roam around some of my albums up there.

I also have many of my photo's on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmacdonnell/){:target="_blank"}.  If you're on there, too, shoot me a friend request.
