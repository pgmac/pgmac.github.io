Google is [updating their Hangouts](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/google-hangouts-and-photos-save-some.html){:target="_blank"} messaging app to include (among other things) SMS integration.  This is both great and scary.  Fingers crossed everything will work nicely and still be secure.

Other updates include:

Location sharing
Animated gifs in your messages
Automatic video contract and brightness changes
HD video calls
And a bunch of other smaller changes
The update will be rolling out over the next few days.  I'm certainly keen to get my grubby mitts on it and start playing around in there.

I remember quite a while ago, Facebook included SMS integration into their messaging app.  I was very reluctant to use this one, I did try, but I just didn't feel comfortable with it.  Only time will tell if I get the same feeling from the Google Hangouts update, too.
