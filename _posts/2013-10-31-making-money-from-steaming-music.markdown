One enterprising computer security professional has made a reasonable amount of money in royalties from several online streaming services; like Spotify, Pandora, etc.

He simply created his own personal version of "songs" that contained garbage.  Certainly not listenable to by anyone with a modicum of sobriety.  He then had these uploaded to the music streaming services.  Next, he crafted several algorithms to emulate a person listening to streaming music, to only play his songs.  He was quickly and easily able to get over 1200 listens to his songs and started amassing the royalties from these plays.

Eventually, the streaming services did find and remove his "songs", but not before he was able to pocket a tidy sum from them.

He believes none of the services have an automated system for checking songs and rely on people reporting bad, wrong and just plain silly songs.
