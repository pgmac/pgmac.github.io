The Mens and Womens Queensland Pirates teams are both competing this weekend at Brisbane Grammar School in the MA Howell Sports Centre.

Come along and see your local Queensland Team take on the visitors from UTSSU over the border.

More details are available on their [Facebook Events](https://www.facebook.com/events/238671252957616/){:target="_blank"} page.

Don't forget to hit up the [Queensland Pirates AVL](http://www.facebook.com/qldavl){:target="_blank"} Facebook page to catch all their latest information.

I'll also be doing some photography on Sunday to capture some of the action.  I'll post a couple of images up here early next week to get you excited for the 3rd home game coming up very soon.
