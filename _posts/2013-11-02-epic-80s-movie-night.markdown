Don't get him wet, keep him out of bright light, and never feed him after midnight.

I was up to feed Saxon foot his late night feed and turned on the television for a little background light and noise to keep me amused and awake, when I spot one of my all time favourite 80's movies is on: [Gremlins](http://www.pgmac.net.au/epic-80s-movie-night/www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/%E2%80%8E){:target="_blank"}. Epic! I haven't seen this in years, it's an absolute classic.

It takes many leaves from many great movies in it's past and weaves then altogether into a brilliant story of boy meets girl, boy losses girl, boy gets mogwai, boy gets gremlins, gremlins get in the machines (blenders, fans, cars, etc, etc), boy saves girl. It's a classic story line that's been known and loved for generations.
Oh yeah, it also helps that said "girl" is none other than the 80's favourite it girl: the incomparable [Phoebe Cates](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000121/?ref_=tt_cl_t12){:target="_blank"} (swoon).

Looks like it's going to be another late night in front of the TV again.

As it turns out, I missed two other of the 80's classics: The Neverending Story 2 and Goonies. Both awesome in their own rights.
I really should keep an eye out for these things, but there's usually so little to watch. Must be ratings season, or something. Either way, I'm a happy little Vegemite right now.
