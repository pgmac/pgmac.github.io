Both the Men's and Women's teams came away with 2 wins from 2 games each.  Tops result that boys and girls.  Really tops stuff.The men were never really pushed too far, only dropping the 1 set from 6, but the games were tightly fought and only a couple runs of points in each set saw them get away.  This keeps the Men's team undefeated for the 2013 season so far.

The women on the other hand, had a brilliant battle with their southern counterparts, coming out victors 3-2 and 3-1.  The girls started slowly but managed to claw their way back into the game each time UTSSU threatened to make a break.  There were some brilliant plays on both sides of the net, with brilliant ups and crunching hits.  It was an absolute joy to watch the women play such quality volleyball.

Remember, you can catch all of the action and keep up to date with how the boys and girls are going on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/qldavl){:target="_blank"} page.

Of course, I have just over 1000 photos to go over now, I've got a start on them and am working my way through.  As soon as I have them ready to go, you'll be the first to know.
