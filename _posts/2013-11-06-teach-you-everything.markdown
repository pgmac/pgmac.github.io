This is quite possibly one of my absolute online comic strips of all time.  Particularly this one:

Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal [The First Human](https://smbc.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-first-human-19x27-poster){:target="_blank"}

There's something about passing your knowledge and experiences on to someone else that is both exciting and fulfilling.  It's just one of the many ways we can live forever.  I've just ordered this poster and will be putting up on the wall in Saxon's room.  I'm very excited to see this and make it happen.
