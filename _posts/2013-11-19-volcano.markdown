Mt Etna volcano eruptions.

Or paroxysms, as they're more affectionately called (in scientific circles).
Recently Mt Etna has been very active again.  Here's 8 minutes of molten rock being hurled in the air with gay abandon.
I find volcano's completely fascinating and definitely have seeing a paroxysm on my bucket list.
