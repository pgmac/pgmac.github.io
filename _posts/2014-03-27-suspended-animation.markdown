Doctors are ready to start human trials of suspending life to perform surgery, or otherwise "fix", patients who have suffered major trauma.

This is completely incredible to me.  We can now effectively "stop" someone who is in exceptionally bad shape, repair them and then "start" them back up again.  This helps remove the danger of bleeding out, haemorrhaging, or many other time critical problems associated with emergency surgery.

Amazing.
