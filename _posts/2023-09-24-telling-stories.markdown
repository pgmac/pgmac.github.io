As we were driving south to start our family holiday, it was getting late at night and my son was getting very tired and refusing to go to sleep without a proper good night story - he loves his good night stories.
We normally read him a story and a couple of kids meditations.
This night we were driving, mum was already asleep in the back with our daughter - also asleep.
Here I am driving and having a story demanded of me.
I can't read him a story, I'm driving.
I'll have to make one up.
I'm not the best at making up stories, but every now and then things come together and pull some magic out - or at least something that works.
These are the stories I made up while driving.

# The sleepy prince

Once upon a time there was a sleepy prince. But no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't get comfortable enough to fall asleep.
Try as he might he just couldn't get comfortable.
He wiggled and jiggled.
He jiggled and wiggled.
But just couldn't get comfortable.

So they called for the royal waiters.
They fetched him snacks and warm milk to help him sleep.
But that didn't work.
He wiggled and jiggled.
He jiggled and wiggled.
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal tailor.
They made him some new pyjamas from the softest, most comforable materical.
But that didn't work.
He wiggled and jiggled.
He jiggled and wiggled.
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal veteraniarian.
They brought the softest, cutest puppies and kittens for him to play with and cuddle.
But that didn't work.
He wiggled and jiggled.
He jiggled and wiggled.
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal storyteller.
They told the most calming and relaxing stories ever told.
Eventually, the little prince drifted off to sleep.
Night night, litle price. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams. And I'll see you in the morning.
