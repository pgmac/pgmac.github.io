As we were driving south to start our family holiday, it was getting late at night and my son was getting very tired and refusing to go to sleep without a proper good night story - he loves his good night stories.
We normally read him a story and a couple of kids meditations.
This night we were driving, mum was already asleep in the back with our daughter - also asleep.
Here I am driving and having a story demanded of me.
I can't read him a story, I'm driving.
I'll have to make one up.
I'm not the best at making up stories, but every now and then things come together and pull some magic out - or at least something that works.
These are the stories I made up while driving.

# The sleepy prince

Once upon a time there was a sleepy prince. But no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't get comfortable enough to fall asleep.<br />
Try as he might he just couldn't get comfortable.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get comfortable.

So they called for the royal waiters.<br />
They fetched him snacks and warm milk to help him sleep.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal tailor.<br />
They made him some new pyjamas from the softest, most comforable materical.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal veteraniarian.<br />
They brought the softest, cutest puppies and kittens for him to play with and cuddle.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal storyteller.<br />
They told the most calming and relaxing stories ever told.<br />
Eventually, the little prince drifted off to sleep.

Night night, little price. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams. And I'll see you in the morning.
