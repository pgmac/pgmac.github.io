As we were driving south to start our family holiday, it was getting late at night and my son was getting very tired and refusing to go to sleep without a proper good night story - he loves his good night stories.
We normally read him a story and a couple of kids meditations.
This night we were driving, mum was already asleep in the back with our daughter - also asleep.
Here I am driving and having a story demanded of me.
I can't read him a story, I'm driving.
I'll have to make one up.
I'm not the best at making up stories, but every now and then things come together and pull some magic out - or at least something that works.
These are the stories I made up while driving.
