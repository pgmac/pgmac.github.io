Once upon a time there was a Sleepy Prince.<br />
No matter how hard he tried he just couldn't get comfortable enough to fall asleep.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal butlers.<br />
The royal butlers fetched the Sleepy Prince some snacks and warm milk to help him sleep.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal <a title="clothes maker">tailor</a>.<br />
The royal tailor made the Sleepy Prince some new pyjamas from the softest, most comfortable material ever.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal <a title="plushie maker">plushie maker</a>.<br />
The royal tailor made the Sleepy Prince a new plushie for him to cuddle.<br />
That worked a little bit.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal <a title="animal doctor">veteraniarian</a>.<br />
The royal veteraniarian brought the Sleepy Prince the softest, cutest puppies and kittens for him to cuddle.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal <a title="story teller">bard</a>.<br />
The royal storyteller told the Sleepy Price the most calming and relaxing stories ever told.<br />
Eventually, the Sleepy Prince slowly drifted off to sleep.

Night night, Sleepy Price. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams. And I'll see you in the morning.
