Once upon a time there was a sleepy prince.<br />
No matter how hard he tried he just couldn't get comfortable enough to fall asleep.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal waiters.<br />
They fetched him snacks and warm milk to help him sleep.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal tailor.<br />
They made him some new pyjamas from the softest, most comfortable material.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal veteraniarian.<br />
They brought the softest, cutest puppies and kittens for him to play with and cuddle.<br />
But that didn't work.<br />
He wiggled and jiggled.<br />
He jiggled and wiggled.<br />
But just couldn't get to sleep.

So they called for the royal storyteller.<br />
They told the most calming and relaxing stories ever told.<br />
Eventually, the little prince drifted off to sleep.

Night night, little price. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams. And I'll see you in the morning.
