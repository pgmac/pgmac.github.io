A long time ago there was a young dragon and he really wanted to go exploring, but he was nervous.

He took a step outside his door.
Then he felt uncomfortable and went back inside his door.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door and walked down the street.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and walked back down the street, to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street and all the way to the edge of town.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and walked back down the street, back to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street, all the way to the edge of town and across the river.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and crossed the river, walked down the street, to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street, all the way to the edge of town, across the river and through the forest.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and went through the forest, crossed the river, walked down the street, to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street, all the way to the edge of town, across the river and through the forest.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and went through the forest, crossed the river, walked down the street, to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street, all the way to the edge of town, across the river, through the forest and over the mountain.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and went over the mountain, through the forest, crossed the river, walked down the street, to his door and went inside.

The next day, he got up again and wanted to go exploring.
He took a step outside his door, walked down the street, all the way to the edge of town, across the river, through the forest, over the mountain and through the plains.
Then he felt uncomfortable. He truned around and went through the plains, over the mountain, through the forest, crossed the river, walked down the street, to his door and went inside.
