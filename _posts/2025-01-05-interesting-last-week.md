## Interesting details

<a name='OpenSPH'>[OpenSPH](https://pavelsevecek.github.io/)</a> - A new graphical application that uses the OpenSPH solver, but with a user interface that is more interactive, intuitive, and easy to use. This version is still under development. If you have any questions, ideas for what to change, or you notice a bug, come chat on the Discord server.

<a name='The 12 Anti-factors of Infrastructure as Code'>[The 12 Anti-factors of Infrastructure as Code](https://itnext.io/the-12-anti-factors-of-infrastructure-as-code-acb52fba3ae0)</a> - As I reflect on the state of infrastructure, Kubernetes, and application configuration, management, and operations at the end of 2024, I find a lot of practices and principles around Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to be questionable and even counterproductive, and many users appear to agree.

<a name='GitHub’s top blogs of 2024'>[GitHub’s top blogs of 2024](https://github.blog/developer-skills/githubs-top-blog-posts-of-2024/)</a> - As 2024 wraps up, we’re revisiting the highlights of a year packed with innovation, learning, and community. From unlocking the power of AI to mastering essential developer tools, these blogs reflect what makes GitHub the home for all developers. Ready? Let’s jump in.

<a name='Run Your Own Private Grammarly Clone Using Docker and LanguageTool'>[Run Your Own Private Grammarly Clone Using Docker and LanguageTool](https://www.howtogeek.com/run-your-own-private-grammarly-clone-using-docker-and-languagetool/)</a> - Summary Don't let AI take over your writing and strip it of its uniqueness (and make you pay for the privilege). LanguageTool provides powerful grammar and word-usage checking without sending your writing to online AI platforms.

<a name='https://imgur.com/gallery/tiger-who-came-pint-sean-lock-hFPQqUr'>[https://imgur.com/gallery/tiger-who-came-pint-sean-lock-hFPQqUr](https://imgur.com/gallery/tiger-who-came-pint-sean-lock-hFPQqUr)</a> - 

<a name='https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog'>[https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog)</a> - Version 3.5.11 of iTerm2 was built on January 2, 2025. This release contains a critical security fix. I strongly recommend updating immediately. Who is affected? ---------------- You may be affected if you used the SSH integration feature in any of the following versions: * 3.5.6 * 3.5.7 * 3.5.

<a name='Two Turntables and a Microphone'>[Two Turntables and a Microphone](https://goodfuzzysounds.com/ma/docs/funnyversion.htm)</a> - I became interested in this subject because I thought it was funny, because the electrical reproducers used in cinemas in the late 1920s look like all-in-one 1970s DJ consoles. The object of this radically minimised version of the main text is to stimulate your interest.
