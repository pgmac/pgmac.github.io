For a while—in the ’80s, ’90s, and early 2000s—it felt like nerds were making the world a better place. Now, it feels like the most successful tech companies are making it worse.

Created for the community by Sysdig. Stratoshark lets you explore and investigate the application-level behavior of your systems.

<a name='No screen, no controller, and absolutely no sense, just a power button and a USB port.'>[No screen, no controller, and absolutely no sense, just a power button and a USB port.](https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/)</a> - The Steam Deck has been a game changer for travel, but I found myself leaving it behind more often than not, as it wouldn’t fit in my backpack, took up a huge amount of carry-on space, and was a hassle to bring down from the overhead compartment when I wanted to use it.
