## Interesting details

<a name='IngressNightmare: 9.8 Critical Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Ingress NGINX'>[IngressNightmare: 9.8 Critical Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Ingress NGINX](https://www.wiz.io/blog/ingress-nginx-kubernetes-vulnerabilities)</a> - This blog provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability and its impact. We will publish our technical deep-dive tomorrow (March 25) at 10AM ET.

<a name='Open-sourcing OpenPubkey SSH (OPKSSH): integrating single sign-on with SSH'>[Open-sourcing OpenPubkey SSH (OPKSSH): integrating single sign-on with SSH](https://blog.cloudflare.com/open-sourcing-openpubkey-ssh-opkssh-integrating-single-sign-on-with-ssh/)</a> - OPKSSH makes it easy to SSH with single sign-on technologies like OpenID Connect, thereby removing the need to manually manage and configure SSH keys. It does this without adding a trusted party other than your identity provider (IdP).
