## Interesting details

<a name='Apache ECharts'>[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)</a> - Apache ECharts provides more than 20 chart types available out of the box, along with a dozen components, and each of them can be arbitrarily combined to use. Easily switch between Canvas and SVG rendering.

<a name='CERN releases report on the feasibility of a possible Future Circular Collider'>[CERN releases report on the feasibility of a possible Future Circular Collider](https://home.cern/news/news/accelerators/cern-releases-report-feasibility-possible-future-circular-collider)</a> - After several years of intense work, CERN and international partners have completed a study to assess the feasibility of a possible Future Circular Collider (FCC).

<a name='https://search.app/1yiQn4N9PWiF9ZtL8'>[https://search.app/1yiQn4N9PWiF9ZtL8](https://cybersecuritynews.com/frida-penetration-testing-tool-kit-released/)</a> - 

<a name='Any program can be a GitHub Actions shell'>[Any program can be a GitHub Actions shell](https://yossarian.net/til/post/any-program-can-be-a-github-actions-shell/)</a> - In GitHub Actions, you can use the shell keyword to specify the shell that runs a given run: block. This keyword is optional for workflows but mandatory for action definitions. The shell normally defaults to something sensible for your runner, e.g. bash on Linux and macOS, and pwsh on Windows.

<a name='The platform engineering toolkit for Kubernetes'>[The platform engineering toolkit for Kubernetes](https://koreo.dev)</a> - Define complex, multi-step processes that react to events and manage the lifecycle of your Kubernetes resources. Koreo workflows enable automation of everything from simple deployments to entire cloud environments. It's like programming—or choreographing—Kubernetes controllers.

<a name='https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-unique-100-hz-sound-that-alleviates-motion-sickness/'>[https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-unique-100-hz-sound-that-alleviates-motion-sickness/](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-unique-100-hz-sound-that-alleviates-motion-sickness/)</a> - 

<a name='Tunarr'>[Tunarr](https://tunarr.com/)</a> - Create live TV channels from media on your Plex/Jellyfin servers, and more! Configure your channels, programs, commercials, and settings using the Tunarr web UI.

<a name='AI-hallucinated code dependencies become new supply chain risk'>[AI-hallucinated code dependencies become new supply chain risk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ai-hallucinated-code-dependencies-become-new-supply-chain-risk/)</a> - A new class of supply chain attacks named 'slopsquatting' has emerged from the increased use of generative AI tools for coding and the model's tendency to "hallucinate" non-existent package names.
