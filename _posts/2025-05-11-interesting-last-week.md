## Interesting details

<a name='Search Rebuilt for AI'>[Search Rebuilt for AI](https://exa.ai)</a> - Yet another fascinating AI product: exa.ai. It crawls the Web, but you can get a list of results via a ChatGPT-prompt.

Users connect to near-Earth orbit satellites through a user terminal, which then connects to the internet via ground gateways.

<a name='Urtext /ˈʊrtekst/'>[Urtext /ˈʊrtekst/](https://urtext.co/)</a> - Urtext /ˈʊrtekst/ is an open-source library for plaintext writing, research, documentation, knowledge bases, journaling, Zettelkasten, project/personal organization, note taking, a lightweight database substitute, or any other writing or information management that can be done in text format.

<a name='Possibly a serious possibility'>[Possibly a serious possibility](https://kucharski.substack.com/p/possibly-a-serious-possibility)</a> - Sherman Kent was rattled. It was March 1951 and Kent, a CIA analyst, had found himself in a troubling conversation about some recent intelligence.

<a name='I'd rather read the prompt'>[I'd rather read the prompt](https://claytonwramsey.com/blog/prompt/)</a> - The downsides of Euler angles make them difficult to utilize in robotics. It’s important to note that very few implementations employ Euler angles for robotics. Instead, one could use rotation matrices or quaternions to facilitate more efficient rotation representation.

<a name='How to Harden GitHub Actions: The Unofficial Guide'>[How to Harden GitHub Actions: The Unofficial Guide](https://www.wiz.io/blog/github-actions-security-guide)</a> - That compromised PAT was used to grant a temporary, malicious user spotbugs/spotbugs repository access  The write access to spotbugs/spotbugs was used to push a malicious workflow to a branch, leaking the Github secrets – including the PAT of a mutual spotbugs and reviewdog contributor  The revi

<a name='Clippy Desktop Assistant'>[Clippy Desktop Assistant](https://felixrieseberg.github.io/clippy/)</a> - Clippy lets you run a variety of large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the 1990s. It's a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy - and the visual design created by Microsoft in that era.

<a name='Mycoria'>[Mycoria](https://mycoria.org/)</a> - Mycoria is an open and secure overlay network that connects all participants. It values freedom of connectivity and aims to imitate the curious and adventurous spirit of the early Internet:
