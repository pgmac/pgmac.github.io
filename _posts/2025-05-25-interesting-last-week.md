## Interesting details

<a name='Should I block ICMP?'>[Should I block ICMP?](http://shouldiblockicmp.com/)</a> - Many network administrators feel that ICMP is a security risk, and should therefore always be blocked at the firewall. It is true that ICMP does have some security issues associated with it, and that a lot of ICMP should be blocked. But this is no reason to block all ICMP traffic!

<a name='Have I Been Pwned 2.0 is Now Live!'>[Have I Been Pwned 2.0 is Now Live!](https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-2-0-is-now-live/)</a> - This has been a very long time coming, but finally, after a marathon effort, the brand new Have I Been Pwned website is now live! Feb last year is when I made the first commit to the public repo for the rebranded service, and we soft-launched the new brand in March of this year.

<a name='KrebsOnSecurity Hit With Near-Record 6.3 Tbps DDoS'>[KrebsOnSecurity Hit With Near-Record 6.3 Tbps DDoS](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/)</a> - KrebsOnSecurity last week was hit by a near record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that clocked in at more than 6.3 terabits of data per second (a terabit is one trillion bits of data).

<a name='Securing CI/CD workflows with Wazuh'>[Securing CI/CD workflows with Wazuh](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/securing-cicd-workflows-with-wazuh.html)</a> - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) refers to practices that automate how code is developed and released to different environments.

<a name='ASD releases joint advice on AI data security'>[ASD releases joint advice on AI data security](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/3993677/asd-releases-joint-advice-on-ai-data-security.html)</a> - “Neglecting these practices can lead to data corruption, compromised models, data leaks, and non-compliance, emphasising the critical importance of robust data security at every phase,” noted the CIS.
