<a name="rv, a new kind of Ruby management tool">[rv, a new kind of Ruby management tool](https://andre.arko.net/2025/08/25/rv-a-new-kind-of-ruby-management-tool/)</a> - For the last ten years or so of working on Bundler, I’ve had a wish rattling around: I want a better dependency manager. It doesn’t just manage your gems, it manages your ruby versions, too. It doesn’t just manage your ruby versions, it installs pre-compiled rubies so you don’t have to wait for ruby to compile from source every time. And more than all of that, it makes it completely trivial to run any script or tool written in ruby, even if that script or tool needs a different ruby than your application does.

<a name="www.abc.net.au">[www.abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-26/near-complete-ichthyosaur-fossil-found-in-western-queensland/105693176)</a> - None

<a name="Critical Docker Desktop flaw lets attackers hijack Windows hosts">[Critical Docker Desktop flaw lets attackers hijack Windows hosts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-docker-desktop-flaw-lets-attackers-hijack-windows-hosts/)</a> - A critical vulnerability in Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS allows compromising the host by running a malicious container, even if the Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) protection is active.

<a name="Commodore raked in over $2 million during the new C64 Ultimate's debut week — roadmap will include three major releases a year | Tom's Hardware">[Commodore raked in over $2 million during the new C64 Ultimate's debut week — roadmap will include three major releases a year | Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/commodore-took-in-over-usd2-million-during-the-c64-ultimates-debut-week-roadmap-will-include-three-major-releases-a-year)</a> - The new Commodore is already thriving with $2m in sales in the first week of the C64 Ultimate's debut.
