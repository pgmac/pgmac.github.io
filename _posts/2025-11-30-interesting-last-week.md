<a name="We stopped roadmap work for a week and fixed bugs"></a>[We stopped roadmap work for a week and fixed bugs](https://lalitm.com/fixits-are-good-for-the-soul/) - It’s Friday at 4pm. I’ve just closed my 12th bug of the week. My brain is completely fried. And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I love regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.
What’s a fixit, you ask?
Once a quarter, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.
Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:

an error message that’s been unclear for two years
a weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same time
a test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyone

The rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.
