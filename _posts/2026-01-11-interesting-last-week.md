From: delicious. Australia

‘Lambassador’ Sam Kekovich is back for his most important job of the year – delivering us the brand new Australian Lamb ad, just in time for summer barbies and chops for dinner, every night.

This unofficial national treasure has been a summer-season fixture for nearly two decades, popping up right on cue to remind us who we are, what we stand for, and why lamb somehow fixes everything. It’s the ad we argue about, quote endlessly, and secretly look forward to every year – even if we pretend we don’t.
