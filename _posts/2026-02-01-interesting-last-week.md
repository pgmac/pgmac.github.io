It’s the Honest Trailer for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King! After an extended edition sized sabbatical in the woods, Aragorn has been given a return to office notice or else he’ll lose his job as the king of all mankind. While The King makes his return, the hobbits return the ring to sender for a full refund, minus shipping and handling (fingering?). It’s the perfect ending to the perfect trilogy, and then it keeps going for another 15-20 minutes but we don’t want it to be over either.

<a name="Formae Documentation"></a>[Formae Documentation](https://docs.formae.io/en/latest/) - Operations and platform teams today are struggling with the immense and growing complexity of their infrastructure. Despite using IaC tools, they are constantly fighting a losing battle against infrastructure drift, undocumented changes, and the operational challenges that come from relying on multiple tools and sources of truth.

That’s where formae comes in. It’s an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platform that unifies your live environment into a single, versioned system of record, giving you the power to safely manage and evolve it with code. It automatically discovers and tracks new resources and changes across your infrastructure, regardless of their origin. formae versions every change in its internal state and makes your infrastructure accessible as code at any level of granularity—always up to date.
