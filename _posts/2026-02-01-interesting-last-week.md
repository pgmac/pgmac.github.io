It’s the Honest Trailer for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King! After an extended edition sized sabbatical in the woods, Aragorn has been given a return to office notice or else he’ll lose his job as the king of all mankind. While The King makes his return, the hobbits return the ring to sender for a full refund, minus shipping and handling (fingering?). It’s the perfect ending to the perfect trilogy, and then it keeps going for another 15-20 minutes but we don’t want it to be over either.
