For subscribers who need wildcard certificates or who prefer not to expose infrastructure to the public Internet, the DNS-01 challenge type has long been the only choice. DNS-01 works well. It is widely supported and battle-tested, but it comes with operational costs: DNS propagation delays, recurring DNS updates at renewal time, and automation that often requires distributing DNS credentials throughout your infrastructure.

I do get it to write some markdown docs to keep in the codebase, usually around getting started, or configuration items. Things you need to run/use the software. These docs point back to the Linear project and Notion docs, too.

<a name="Scientists discover recent tectonic activity on the moon"></a>[Scientists discover recent tectonic activity on the moon](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-scientists-tectonic-moon.html) - Scientists have produced the first global map and analysis of small mare ridges (SMRs) on the moon, a characteristic geological feature of tectonic activity. Published in The Planetary Science Journal Dec. 24, 2025, the analysis performed by scientists at the National Air and Space Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies and colleagues reveals for the first time that SMRs are geologically young and are widespread across the lunar maria—the vast, dark plains on the moon's surface. The team's discovery of how SMRs form introduces a new set of potential moonquake sources that could affect future site selections for lunar landings.

Systems fail in ways we do not expect. Yet we still predict. Practices evolve faster than documentation. Yet we still write. We think about what's next. Yet we respond to right now.

And while so much other research most certainly arrives with word-stuffed pages, as if more words mean more learning, we chose the uncertain opposite. That is, the strength of this report comes from its quiet simplicity, its restraint, and its lack of distraction. Each insight was written not to impress, but to simply present.

After eight years of tracing reliability’s arc, the view feels complete enough to pause and look back before seeing how far the boundaries have widened. Reliability is no longer only about sustaining uptime (was it ever?). It has moved from reliability to resilience, from uptime to experience, from toil to intelligence, from tools to strategy, and from systems to people.

There are still no certainties, but there is progress. And that remains enough reason to keep building.
