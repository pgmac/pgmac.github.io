## Interesting details

<a name="How far back in time can you understand English?"></a>[How far back in time can you understand English?](https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/how-far-back-in-time-understand-english) - I made it back to the 1400's ok. Further than that needed more focus and attention than I had available at the time.

> I got as far as the 1400's OK. There were some words that took a couple/few readings to comprehend, but I could usually infer their meaning from the context around.
> 
> The long &quot;s&quot; character (ſ) threw me a bit, but when I mostly figured it out, it actually because easy/comfortable to read.
> 
> It was when it started to into more of the &quot;Olde English&quot; letters/characters where I really started to struggle. I have read about some/most of them in the past, but I wasn't able to place and use them during my reading of this. Mostly because I don't use them much, so don't maintain a working knowledge and/or usage of them.
> 
> Either way, this was a fun experience.

<a name="A Botnet Accidentally Destroyed I2P"></a>[A Botnet Accidentally Destroyed I2P](https://www.sambent.com/a-botnet-accidentally-destroyed-i2p-the-full-story/) - On February 3, 2026, the I2P anonymity network was flooded with 700,000 hostile nodes in what became one of the most devastating Sybil attacks an anonymity network has ever experienced. The network normally operates with 15,000 to 20,000 active devices. The attackers overwhelmed it by a factor

<a name="How I use Claude Code: Separation of planning and execution"></a>[How I use Claude Code: Separation of planning and execution](https://boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code/) - The research-plan-implement workflow I use to build software with Claude Code, and why I never let it write code until I've approved a written plan.

> [Found @ YCombinator Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47106686)

> I've started asking Claude to create tickets (in Linear) and keeping them updated with all the work and decisions we make during planning/research mode.
> Then, getting Claude to create Notion pages with the output of the work, explaining the implementation and how to use it.
> 
> I like that because it makes the thought process and all those decisions obvious, or at least easily discoverable and reusable in a place that makes sense and is outside the codebase where it doesn't always need to belong. I do get it to write some markdown docs to keep in the codebase, usually around getting started, or configuration items. Things you need to run/use the software. These docs point back to the Linear project and Notion docs, too.

<a name="Scientists discover recent tectonic activity on the moon"></a>[Scientists discover recent tectonic activity on the moon](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-scientists-tectonic-moon.html) - Scientists have produced the first global map and analysis of small mare ridges (SMRs) on the moon, a characteristic geological feature of tectonic activity. Published in The Planetary Science Journal Dec. 24, 2025, the analysis performed by scientists at the National Air and Space Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies and colleagues reveals for the first time that SMRs are geologically young and are widespread across the lunar maria—the vast, dark plains on the moon's surface. The team's discovery of how SMRs form introduces a new set of potential moonquake sources that could affect future site selections for lunar landings.

<a name="The SRE Report 2026"></a>[The SRE Report 2026](https://resources.catchpoint.com/hubfs/Website%20Assets%20-%20Briefs%2c%20EBooks%2c%20etc/The%20SRE%20Report%202026%20Catchpoint.pdf) - Reliability among uncertainty.

Systems fail in ways we do not expect. Yet we still predict. Practices evolve faster than documentation. Yet we still write. We think about what's next. Yet we respond to right now.

And while so much other research most certainly arrives with word-stuffed pages, as if more words mean more learning, we chose the uncertain opposite. That is, the strength of this report comes from its quiet simplicity, its restraint, and its lack of distraction. Each insight was written not to impress, but to simply present.

After eight years of tracing reliability’s arc, the view feels complete enough to pause and look back before seeing how far the boundaries have widened. Reliability is no longer only about sustaining uptime (was it ever?). It has moved from reliability to resilience, from uptime to experience, from toil to intelligence, from tools to strategy, and from systems to people.

There are still no certainties, but there is progress. And that remains enough reason to keep building.
